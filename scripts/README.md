#Conflerge
*Conflerge* is custom mergetool that strives to automatically resolve merge conflicts. This is an attempt to demonstrate that finer grain merging, unlike the line-by-line merging in Git, can result in fewer false-positive conflicts with a competitive false-negative rate. 

We attempted finer grain merging with two approaches: Token-based and Abstract Syntax Tree based. 

###Tokenization
A token is an individual keyword in source code such as a reserved keyword, variable name or constant. For example, tokenizing the Java statement `System.out.println(hello);` yields the token sequence `[ System .  out .  println (  hello  ) ; ]` We use the [Wagner-Fischer Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagner%E2%80%93Fischer_algorithm) [1] to find the edit distance between **BASE** and **LOCAL**, and between **BASE** and **REMOTE**.

###Abstract Syntax Trees 
In contrast to tokens, Abstract Syntax Trees retain information about the syntactic structure of the code as hierarchical parent-child relationships. Each node has an ordered set of children. We use the mmdiff algorithm [2] to find the edit distance between **BASE** and **LOCAL**, and between **BASE** and **REMOTE**.


#Architecture

*Conflerge* is implemented as a mergetool. Git provides the relevant versions of **BASE**, **LOCAL** and **REMOTE**. We use [javaparser](https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser) to parse and unparse the source code files. We also use it for tokenization and the construction of abstract syntax trees. 

#Usage

*Conflerge* is currently scoped to work with Java source code files and Git. 

### Reproducing results

1. Clone the *Conflerge* repository to ~/.
2. Update your `.gitconfig` to include: ```
    [mergetool "conflerge-tree"]
		cmd = java -jar ~/Conflerge/scripts/ConflergeTree.jar \$BASE \$LOCAL \$REMOTE \$MERGED
    [mergetool "conflerge-token"]
        cmd = java -jar ~/Conflerge/scripts/ConflergeToken.jar \$BASE \$LOCAL \$REMOTE \$MERGED
    [merge]
        tool = conflerge-tree
        tool = conflerge-token
```
3. Ensure that all `.sh` files in `Conflerge/scripts` have run permission
4. Clone the repository to be tested to ` /tmp`  

5. From inside `Conflerge/scripts`, run:

`bash test_repo.sh <repository name> <repository owner>-<repository name> <tree or token>`

For example, to test  [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) using the tree merge strategy:
`bash test_repo.sh glide bumptech-glide tree`

* Specifying the positional argument as either `tree` or `token` is required, and determines whether to evaluate Conflerge using a tree or token based merge strategy
* 	As the script runs it will output test results for each individual repo to files in the form `[repo]_[merge_strategy].csv` (ie `glide_tree.csv`)
