#Conflerge
*Conflerge* is custom mergetool that strives to automatically resolve merge conflicts. This is an attempt to demonstrate that finer grain merging, unlike the line-by-line merging in Git, can result in fewer false-positive conflicts with a competitive false-negative rate. 

We attempted finer grain merging with two approaches: Token-based and Abstract Syntax Tree based. 

###Tokenization
A token is an individual keyword in source code such as a reserved keyword, variable name or constant. For example, tokenizing the Java statement `System.out.println(hello);` yields the token sequence `[ System .  out .  println (  hello  ) ; ]` We use the [Wagner-Fischer Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagner%E2%80%93Fischer_algorithm) [1] to find the edit distance between **BASE** and **LOCAL**, and between **BASE** and **REMOTE**.

###Abstract Syntax Trees 
In contrast to tokens, Abstract Syntax Trees retain information about the syntactic structure of the code as hierarchical parent-child relationships. Each node has an ordered set of children. We use the mmdiff algorithm [2] to find the edit distance between **BASE** and **LOCAL**, and between **BASE** and **REMOTE**.


#Architecture

*Conflerge* is implemented as a mergetool. Git provides the relevant versions of **BASE**, **LOCAL** and **REMOTE**. We use [javaparser](https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser) to parse and unparse the source code files. We also use it for tokenization and the construction of abstract syntax trees. 

#Usage

*Conflerge* is currently scoped to work with Java source code files and Git. 

To use the tool:

* Clone the *Conflerge* repository to ~/.
* Update your `.gitconfig` to include: 
```bash
    [mergetool "conflerge-tree"]
		cmd = java -jar ~/Conflerge/ConflergeTree.jar \$BASE \$LOCAL \$REMOTE \$MERGED
    [mergetool "conflerge-token"]
        cmd = java -jar ~/Conflerge/ConflergeToken.jar \$BASE \$LOCAL \$REMOTE \$MERGED
    [merge]
        tool = conflerge-tree
        tool = conflerge-token
```
* To run with token-based merging:
`git mergetool --tool=conflerge-token <conflicting file>`
* To run with AST-based merging:
`git mergetool --tool=conflerge-tree <conflicting file>`

* Note: Our experiments showed that AST-based merging was the more successful strategy, so we recommend using `conflerge-tree`.
