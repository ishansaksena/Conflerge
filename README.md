#Conflerge
*Conflerge* is custom mergetool that strives to automatically resolve merge conflicts. This is an attempt to demonstrate that finer grain merging, unlike the line-by-line merging in Git, can result in fewer false-positive conflicts with a competitive false-negative rate. 

We attempted finer grain merging with two approaches: Token-based and Abstract Syntax Tree based. 

###Tokenization
A token is an individual keyword in source code such as a reserved keyword, variable name or constant. For example, tokenizing the Java statement `System.out.println(hello);` yields the token sequence `[ System .  out .  println (  hello  ) ; ]` We use the [Wagner-Fischer Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagner%E2%80%93Fischer_algorithm) [1] to find the edit distance between **BASE** and **LOCAL**, and between **BASE** and **REMOTE**.

###Abstract Syntax Trees 
In contrast to tokens, Abstract Syntax Trees retain information about the syntactic structure of the code as hierarchical parent-child relationships. Each node has an ordered set of children. We use the mmdiff algorithm [2] to find the edit distance between **BASE** and **LOCAL**, and between **BASE** and **REMOTE**.


##Architecture

Git provides the relevant versions of **BASE**, **LOCAL** and **REMOTE**. We use [javaparser](https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser) to parse and unparse the source code files. We also use it for tokenization and the construction of abstract syntax trees. 

Usage
===================
*Conflerge* is currently scoped to work with Java source code files and Git.
